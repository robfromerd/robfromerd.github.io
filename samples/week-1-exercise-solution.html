        /* INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. The client wants the image to bleed full width, the text in the paragraphs to be 80% 
of the browser window (but wants a smaller margin on mobile) and wants the code to 
be semantically correct.  

2. First link the bootstrap-reboot.css file (from the URL below) within the head
of this file.

3. Begin to build a semantic structure for the page that allows the
image to go full width but the text to have a margin from the edge of
the browser. 

4. 
a.) Wrap everything within the body in a main element, 
b.) create two section elements within it, 
c.) put the full width image in the first section, 
d.) put the paragraphs within a div in the second section
e.) write a rule that sets the paragraphs off from the edge of the browser via 
a class you create and add to this div.
f.) write a media query to change the div's width to be larger at a mobile size.

                <p>Browsers have a default margin of 8 pixels on the body element.
                    However, the client wants the image of the design center to bleed full width&mdash;
                    with the text's line length limited at a desktop view.</p>

                <p>They even gave you
                    a mockup they made in Figma:</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Working developers today do not write a whole bunch of
                    browser default rules. Instead they use a pre-made set of rules <a href="https://raw.githack.com/twbs/bootstrap/v4-dev/dist/css/bootstrap-reboot.css">like this one from Bootstrap</a>.

                    <p><a href="https://codepen.io/robfromerd/pen/BaKpeBe">Here is a Codepen example</a>
                        of different ways of starting out with either a reboot or
                        "normalized" version of these pesky browser resets.</p>
